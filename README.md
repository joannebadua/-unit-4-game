# About
This is a game to teach kids about the importance of recycling, and being aware of carbon footprint scores.
Click the any of the four recycling bins as buttons, each secretly assigned with a random number. The more you click, the more points you accumulate. 

Your goal is to match the player carboon footprint score with the goal carbon footprint score. Try and guess how much points each bin is worth so you can add the specific amount of points to meet your carbon footprint goal.  You don't know the amount until you click on the recycling bin.  You click on a recycling bin.  The player loses if their score goes above the random number.  The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses, resulting in a new goal carbon footprint score, and the player's score reset to zero.
